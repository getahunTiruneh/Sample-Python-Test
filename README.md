# Sample-Python-Test-Repo

This repository is designed as a training resource to demonstrate the best practices for Python project folder structure and unit testing. The goal is to provide a clear and well-organized template that can be used as a reference for creating Python projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:


- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `module1.py`, `module2.py`: Example Python modules with functions to be tested.
  - `__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.

- **tests/**: Contains the unit tests for the project.
  - `test_module1.py`, `test_module2.py`: Test files corresponding to the modules in the `src/` directory.
  - `__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.

- **docs/**: Contains documentation for the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.
